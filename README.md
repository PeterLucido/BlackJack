## Object of the game
The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 without going over.

## Card Values/Scoring 
It is up to the player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10, and any other card is its number value.

## The Deal
The dealer deals out one card to the player faces up, and one card to itself faces up. Another card is dealt to the player face up and one to the dealer face down. 

## Naturals
If the player's first two cards are an ace and a picture card or a ten giving the count of 21 in two cards, this is blackjack. If the player has blackjack and the dealer does not, the player wins. If the dealer has blackjack then and the player does not, the player automatically loses. If the player and the dealer have blackjack, it is a tie. 

## The Play
Once cards are dealt, the player (if they don't have blackjack they will either have to decide to "Hit" or "Stay". A player may stand on the two cards initially dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under) or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the case of a bust, the player loses.

## The Dealers Play
The dealer's face-down card is turned up when the dealer has served the player. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player can always take one or more cards.

## Motivation 
My brother Joe loves to gamble, and he was the one who pushed me toward this course, so I decided to create a game for him to playâ€”showing my appreciation.
